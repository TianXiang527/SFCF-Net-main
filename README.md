# Spatial-Frequency Cross-Fusion Network (SFCF-Net)
### Author: Xiang Tian
This repository stores the deep learning model 'SFCF-Net' 
in the paper: Multi-path Fusion in SFCF-Net for Enhanced Multi-frequency Electrical Impedance Tomography.

The SFCF-Net algorithm is proposed to address the problem of the multi-frequency electrical impedance tomography (mfEIT) in the imaging of the multi-class lesion targets when the conductivity of background tissues is frequency-dependent.
